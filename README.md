# MongoDB's Navbar
The goal of this project was to recreate [MongoDB's NavBar](https://www.mongodb.com/) animation. I wouldn't say I'm 100% successful in this, however the animation without the extra keyframes to add the "wiggle" effect, is pretty close.

## Implementation 
The navbar makes use of some [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) helper classes. Javascript is all completely vanilla ðŸŽ‰.
